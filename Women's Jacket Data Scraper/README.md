# Patagonia Women's Jackets Scraper

## Overview

The Patagonia Women's Jackets Scraper is a web scraping tool developed in Python to extract data about women's jackets from the Patagonia brand website. The scraper is designed to collect information such as Product URL, Product Image, Product Title, Price, Rating, and Review Count for each jacket.

The project consists of two Python scripts: `scraper1.py` and `scraper2.py`. `scraper1.py` utilizes the functionality of clicking the "Load More" button on the website, while `scraper2.py` follows a pagination approach for data extraction. Both scripts leverage the Selenium library for web automation, along with other standard Python libraries such as csv and Javascript for enhanced functionality.

## Features

- **Dynamic Page Loading (scraper1.py):** The script employs the Selenium library to handle dynamic content loading by clicking the "Load More" button on the Patagonia website. This ensures that all relevant pages are loaded before data extraction.

- **Pagination (scraper2.py):** The script uses a pagination approach to navigate through multiple pages on the website, systematically scraping data from each page.

- **Data Extraction Fields:**
  - Product URL
  - Product Image
  - Product Title
  - Price
  - Rating
  - Review Count

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following dependencies are installed before running the scripts:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

## Usage

### scraper1.py

```bash
python scraper1.py
```

- The script will launch a web browser, navigate to the Patagonia website, and automatically click the "Load More" button to load additional pages.
- Extracted data will be saved to a CSV file named `patagonia_women_jackets_data.csv`.

### scraper2.py

```bash
python scraper2.py
```

- The script will navigate through paginated pages on the Patagonia website, extracting data from each page.
- Extracted data will be saved to a CSV file named `patagonia_women_jackets_data.csv`.

## Configuration

Both scripts have a configurable variable `output_file` where you can specify the desired output filename for the CSV file.

```python
output_file = "patagonia_women_jackets_data.csv"
```

## Notes

- Ensure that you have the latest version of the Selenium WebDriver installed and the browser driver executable available in your system's PATH.
- The scripts are designed for educational and personal use. Respect the website's terms of service and consider rate-limiting to avoid unnecessary strain on the server.
