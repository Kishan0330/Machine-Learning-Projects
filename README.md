#House Price Prediction
This Project involves using ML algorithms to analyze factors influencing
property prices in Bengaluru. It includes collecting and processing data
on variables. ML models are then trained on data to make predictions
about future property prices.

#Movie Recommender System
A Movie Recommender System that suggests movies to users based on
similar movies. I have used Jupyter notebook, pandas for data
manipulation, Pickle for model serialization, and Streamlit for creating
a web interface.

#Stock Market Price Prediction
Utilized Jupyter Notebook to preprocess stock data with Pandas and
NumPy. Developed an LSTM model for stock price prediction.
Integrated the model into a web app using Dash for interactive
visualization
